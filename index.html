<h3> How to Play </h3>
<p> Each player creates a deck of 60 cards. These cards are typically a mix of energy, pokemon, and trainers. Play begins with the calling of a coin flip. The winner gets to choice who begins first. During the first turn, a player may bench pokemon, play up to one support card and attach up to one energy. During the second turn, a player may do all of the above and may also attack the defending pokemon and evolve benched pokemon. Play continues in this manner until one player has one the match. </p>
<h3> How to Win </h3>
<p> A player can win the game in one of three ways. 
	<ul>
		<li>First, you will win the game automatically if your opponents runs out of cards in their deck.</li>
		<li>Second, you can collect all six of your prize cards. </li>
		<em>(One prize card is gained by killing a non-EX pokemon, two are taken for EX pokemon)</em> 
		<li>Lastly, you can kill all of your opponents active and benched pokemon. </li>
	</ul>
<h3> Pokemon Types </h3>
<p> Pokemon types will determine their weaknesses and resistance to the opposing pokemon's attacks. See below for a table detailing a few common type differences. Keep in mind that this list is not all inclusive - there are several more types of Pokemon.</p>
