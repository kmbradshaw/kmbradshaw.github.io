<h3> How to Play </h3>
<p> Each player creates a deck of 60 cards. These cards are typically a mix of energy, pokemon, and trainers. Play begins with the calling of a coin flip. The winner gets to choice who begins first. During the first turn, a player may bench pokemon, play up to one support card and attach up to one energy. During the second turn, a player may do all of the above and may also attack the defending pokemon and evolve benched pokemon. Play continues in this manner until one player has won the match. </p>
<h3> How to Win </h3>
<p> A player can win the game in one of three ways. 
	<ul>
		<li>First, you will win the game automatically if your opponents runs out of cards in their deck.</li>
		<li>Second, you can collect all six of your prize cards. </li>
		<em>(One prize card is gained by killing a Non EX Pokemon, two are taken for EX Pokemon)</em> 
		<li>Lastly, you can kill all of your opponents active and benched Pokemon - even if this totals to less than six prize cards</li>
	</ul>
<h3> Pokemon Types </h3>
<p> Pokemon types will determine their weaknesses and resistance to the opposing pokemon's attacks. See below for a table detailing a few common type differences. Keep in mind that this list is not all inclusive - there are several more types of Pokemon.</p>

<h3> The secret to Winning Tournaments </h3>
<p> A solidly put together deck - that's it. Come up with a strategy and stick to it. I like to base mine around specific combinations of Pokemon. You can find my most played card <a href="images/florges.html"> here.</a> </p>

<h4><a href="http://z8.invisionfree.com/TCG2/ar/t94.htm">Similar Website</a></h4>
<p>I picked a fairly simple site to reference so there are quite a few tags I recognize (in addition to the the general html layout). They use the a header tag to create a link at the top, several line breaks, the center tag and link tags throughout. There is a large section of tag at the beginning of the code I didn't recognize that I'm pretty sure creates the banner image and link on the page.  Lastly, instead of using the < em > tag for emphasis they are using the < i > tag. I'm assuming for italics. They seem to work the same, at least in the website layout I've created so far. We disagree on different Pokemon weaknesses but importantly they dated their page. The differences could come from game updates in the last four years. Adding a date seems like a good tool for reference sites, such as the linked page, that you don't intend to keep up with. I didn't add one on mine because I'm assuming we will transform this page soon.</p>
